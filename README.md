# playBlackJack

A small web-based Blackjack game with local saves, animations, and SFX.

Usage:

- Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox).
- The game auto-saves to `localStorage`. Use the Save/Load buttons to manage saves.
- Starts with $10,000. If balance hits 0, you receive $2,500 automatically.

Files:

- `index.html` — main UI
- `style.css` — styles and animations
- `app.js` — game logic and audio

Notes:

- This is a local, single-player demo with fake money only.
- Audio uses the WebAudio API and may require a user gesture to start.

Enjoy!
